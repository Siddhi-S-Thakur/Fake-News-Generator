Fake-News-Generator

This Python script generates random fake news headlines for fun.

It uses the random module to randomly select elements from predefined lists of subjects, actions, and places.

The random module is a built-in Python library used to perform random operations.
In this project, it's used to randomly pick one item from each list to form a complete sentence.

Each time the script runs, it combines a subject, an action, and a place into a humorous or absurd headline.

The process continues in a loop until the user decides to stop.

This project is a simple demonstration of how randomness works in Python, and it also shows how to work with lists and string formatting
